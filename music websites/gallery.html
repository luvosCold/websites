     <h2>MY STORY</h2>
   </div>
<p>I am a song writer and i make beats on my own also a producer.Its been six years doing music and i see no changes. Back from EKASI(where i was born) lot of people support my work and i am happy because they give me energy.The reason why i decided to produce my music while i am a song writer is that,
Most of the producers need more money that i can not afford.
Now it`s better and im not giving up and it`s very hard. i just tell my self that one day im going to make it and make my family proud of me.
